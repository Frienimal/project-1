We recommend attaching your dog’s lead to a harness so they don’t experience pressure round the neck if they pull. Make sure it’s a harness that allows your puppy to walk and run naturally, as opposed to one that restricts the way they move.

                <p id="blog-content">Regular grooming is important for dogs of all breeds – it helps them maintain a shiny, tangle-free coat and gives you the chance to check for parasite infestations and skin issues, improving their overall hygiene. Plus, grooming can be a one-on-one bonding experience for you and your pet. <br>
                Even dogs with short, low-maintenance coats need regular brushing, bathing and nail trimming. Dogs with longer coats may also need clipping and hair trimming. While you may wish to schedule regular appointments with a professional groomer – especially when it comes to clipping and trimming your dog’s hair – these seven tips will help you establish an at-home grooming routine with your dog. <br>
                Most dog owners prefer to take their dog to a groomer to have their dog’s hair cut. That said, if you proceed carefully you can trim overgrown hair around your dog’s eyes or paws in between professional groomings. Trimming the hair around your dog’s eyes can prevent overgrown hair from blocking its vision and rubbing against and damaging its eyes. <br>
                Always wait until your dog is calm and preferably lying down. Move slowly and calmly, and use extra caution when scissor blades are near the skin. Make sure to reward your dog’s calmness with a treat after you’re finished. <br>
                Trimming the hair inside the ears can improve air movement and help prevent ear infections. However, this is best done by an experienced groomer or at your vet clinic. <br>
                <b>Remember: It’s easy to accidentally cut your pet with scissors or clippers. Always take care when trimming, and if you’re nervous or would prefer not to trim your dog’s hair yourself, turn to a professional grooming service.</b></p>

                        Before you bring home the happiness that’s a dog, please consider his age, size, grooming needs, health issues, and activity level.
                        It wouldn’t make sense to adopt a large dog if you live in a small flat. Similarly, furry breeds’ native to hills won’t be comfortable in say Chennai’s humidity or Delhi’s sweltering heat. <br>
                        Go for a high energy dog if you have an active lifestyle. You’d, in this case, be required to channelize your dog’s energies by stimulation games – tips and tricks and exercises else you might see yourself complaining that ‘My dog is destructive as he tears household items apart’.
                        <br>
                        A sedentary life in the apartment or yard isn’t a dog’s idea of fun. They’re active animals who love to move around, sniff, explore and engage with the world. A dedicated dog owner will work through any issues, relocations, lifestyle changes, vet visits but alas not many who adopt a dog fall in this rare category. </p>

                        <p id="blog-content">There your dog goes again, chasing after another critter in your backyard. While their favorite little animals might be squirrels, your dog doesn't discriminate. If they see a bunny, raccoon, possum or anything else — they chase. Why does your dog chase squirrels and other furry critters?
                            <br>
                            So far, the behavior hasn't caused much of a problem, but you're worried that the chasing may lead to your dog getting loose and then lost — or worse, getting bitten by the other animal. If you've been pondering why your dog like to chase squirrels, this guide will explain why the behavior occurs and whether or not you can make it stop.There are many reasons why your dog may chase little creatures, like raccoons, porcupines, skunks and chipmunks, but the most common are curiosity, playfulness and predatory drive. <br>
                            A young puppy, for example, may be intrigued by fast moving critters and chase after them to find out what they're doing, or to join in and "play" with them. This natural curiosity is wonderful, but it's important to keep a close eye on your pet while outdoors. You don't want them to wander away while chasing a prey, and you wouldn't want them to be bitten by a small animal either!</p>

                            <p id="blog-content">Cats do love to stretch out and bask in the sun. However, she may enjoy it so much that she stays out long enough to risk getting a sunburn – especially if she has a light-coloured coat, or a pink nose or pink skin.  <br>
                                When summertime is around, remember to take extra care. Here’s how you can keep your cat cool. <br>
                                Does she love the sun too much? <br>
                                Help your cat by setting up areas of shade in her favourite sunbathing spots. She will love cardboard boxes. Try turning one on its side and create a shelter for her to sleep in. <br>
                                There’s a chance that she may ignore the shade you create and simply move back to a sunny spot. Try keeping her indoors during the middle of the day, when the sunshine is at its peak. <br>
                                Bring out the sunscreen.
                                Choose a non-toxic variety of sunscreen to protect her skin and ears – she may not enjoy it at first and try to wipe it off, but she’ll get used to it.
                                Greenhouses and enclosed structures <br>
                                If you have a greenhouse or similar structures, make sure you keep the door locked to keep your cat from wandering inside. If she gets trapped inside during the summer months, your cat could suffer from heat exhaustion. Discourage your cat from sunning herself on the roof, rails, or ledges too.</p>
